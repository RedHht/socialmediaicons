# Social Media Icons

This is a pack of stylized icons with 4 social networks, Twitter Instagram LinkedIn and Facebook, these are designed to be easily editable and adapt to the web page you are creating thanks to SASS

You can download the complete package which includes HTML CSS and SCSS or download the _smicons file in the scss folder and include it in another .scss file with @use "smicons";

This is my first creation uploaded to GitHub, I am not a professional but I do what I can, thanks for using these icons, I really appreciate it 😊
